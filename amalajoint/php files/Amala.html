            <div class="gprec"><img src="../html file/image/Amala proper.jpg"  alt="" height= "300px" width="300px" ></div>
            <h4 text-align:left;>Amala is a traditional staple food for the part of Yoruba tribe in southwestern part of Nigeria. It's a type of swallow, which is a staple food in southwestern part of Nigeria. Amala is has a dark brownish colour. Texture-wise, it is firmer than mashed potatoes because of its low moisture and high starch content. The ingredients for making elubo( the flour), for amala are sundried, so, they lose most of their moisture. They, however, retain their nutrients. Most elubo flours are rich in fibre and protein.
                Swallows are typically served as accompaniments with favorite soups.
